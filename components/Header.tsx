              The Advisory Mentorship Programme pairs students with working
              professionals in their fields of interest on a 1-1 basis. Over the
              course of four months, mentors give an hour each month to meet
              with their mentee. Over the past 2 years, the programme delivered
              over 8,000 hours of mentorship to 2,211 students with the
              involvement of 1,826 mentors. This year, weâ€™re excited to share
              that over 1,600 working professionals and 27 mentorship partners
              whose fields of expertise range across 48 different industries
              have come aboard in support of this programme.
