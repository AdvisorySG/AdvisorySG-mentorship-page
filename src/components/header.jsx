          The Advisory Mentorship Programme pairs students with working
          professionals in their fields of interest on a 1-1 basis. Over the
          course of four months, from June to September 2021, mentors give an
          hour each month to meet with their mentee. In its first run in 2020,
          the programme delivered over 2,000 hours of mentorship to 694 students
          with the involvement of over 562 mentors. This year, we are delighted
          to have more than 850 mentors, including from 16 mentorship partners,
          whose fields of expertise range across 48 different industries.
