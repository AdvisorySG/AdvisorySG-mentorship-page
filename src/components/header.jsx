          The Advisory Mentorship Programme pairs students with working
          professionals in their fields of interest on a 1-1 basis. Over the
          course of four months, from September to December 2021, mentors give
          an hour each month to meet with their mentee. In its first run in
          2020, the programme delivered over 2000 hours of mentorship to 694
          students with the involvement of over 562 mentors. This year, for Wave
          1 of the programme which is taking place from June to September 2021,
          nearly 900 working professionals came aboard as mentors for 1,104
          mentees. For Wave 2, we are pleased to have over 400 mentors,
          including from 10 mentorship partners, whose fields of expertise range
          across 48 different industries.
