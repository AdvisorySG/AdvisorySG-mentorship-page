          With the spread of COVID-19, and as many students face concerns,
          frustration and uncertainty about their studies, graduation, and
          career opportunities - Advisory is looking to support affected
          students. By matching students aged 16-25 with industry mentors from
          their field of interest one-to-one on a three-month basis from May to
          July, we hope to assist students to make informed career choices, and
          provide students with support and advice in these uncertain times.
