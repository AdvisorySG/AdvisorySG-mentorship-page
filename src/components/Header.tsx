              The Advisory Mentorship Programme pairs students with working
              professionals in their fields of interest on a 1-1 basis. Over the
              course of four months, from June to September 2022, mentors give
              an hour each month to meet with their mentee. Over the past 2
              years, the programme delivered over 8,000 hours of mentorship to
              2,211 students with the involvement of 1,826 mentors. This year,
              weâ€™re excited to share that over 1,600 working professionals and
              27 mentorship partners whose fields of expertise range across 48
              different industries have come aboard in support of this
              programme.
