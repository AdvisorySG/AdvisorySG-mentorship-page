Besides interning in banking and tech consulting, I worked with a deep tech research team in NUS helping them launch a startup and currently heading a fintech enabled investment management platform at a venture capital called Hatcher+. These experiences have helped me built up a diverse range of skills including technical, communication, team management and setting up businesses from scratch. I recently completed my part-time Masters in Computing in Information Systems from NUS while working at NUS. In my free time, I like to play tennis and cricket while exploring my interests in simulation racing and product development.",

He holds a B.A. (Hons) in English Literature from the National University of Singapore, from which he graduated with Highest Distinction; and where he studied on sponsorship of the Government of Singapore, as a Public Service Commission (Teaching Service) Scholarship recipient. Under its provisions, Brendan—impassioned about education—will join Singapore’s Ministry of Education as a General Education Officer, upon graduation from post-graduate studies.\n\nHe serves as Captain of the 33J Boys’ Brigade Singapore Company, the largest Company in The Boys’ Brigade in Singapore with around 200 primary school Boys annually. During his tenure, the Company placed first at the national-level Character Quest competition thrice consecutively; and fifth, third, and finally, first in 2019, at the Adventure Quest. At the national level, Brendan holds appointments as Committee Member on the Brigade’s Local Development and Juniors Programme Committees; and previously had portfolios on Explorers Programme Working Committee, and the Adventure and Character Quest Committees — the latter of which he has received repeated nominations for in subsequent years.\n\nIn 2016, he co-founded Advisory, a registered non-profit society that empowers youth to make informed career and further education choices. Brendan now leads Advisory as Deputy President (External), managing external and stakeholder relations; and strategic development and execution of front-facing programming.\n\nHis past civil society engagements include representing Singapore as a delegate for the inaugural Singapore-Zhejiang Youth Leadership Exchange Programme; planning the return visit of and hosting the Zhejiang Youth Federation in Singapore; and researching on linguistics, dementia-friendly communities, and assisted living facilities.",

At the former I was a Jardine Scholar, and I got a First for my BA, and a Distinction for my MPhil.\nThe greatest value of a classical education is that it foregrounds the question, 'what does it mean to be human?'\nThis question is the second side to my story: the contemplative and collaborative search for fellowship and community.\nThat's why, when I came back to Singapore, I decided to understand and be part of the shaping of my country's narrative.\nBy working at the intersection of the people, public, and private sectors, my work at NVPC tries to do just that.\nBut there is more to do, and I want to reach out to the community in other informal ways - hence my application.",

I am happy where I am now and I am blessed to be able to brave 7.30am days without grouchiness. As a teenager many years back, I probably would not have envisioned myself to be where I am at now.

I have been lucky in my lifetime to have had fantastic role models and mentors to show me direction and having gone through a career myself I know first-hand the importance of a guiding force. As mentioned in my bio, I would like to give back to the Singapore community while here and if anyone would like mentoring through a career in management consulting or a career change, I would be more than happy to help.",

      "Biography": "Having taken Accountancy Degree in both polytechnic and university, I do have a certain amount of tacit knowledge in the business world. Work wise, I have taken up several different jobs such as accounts assistance, financial consultant, audit intern, merger and acquisition analyst etc.\nAs I am someone who is more analytical and would prefer to get exposure to different kind of problems, I decided to dive into the field of Risk Management. From there, I gathered research on what are the requirements and responsibilities expected of me and find out what are the knowledge gaps that I would need to fill in. Thereafter, I enrolled in the Minor of Risk Management and Insurance in NTU and was subsequently awarded. My efforts paid off and I was able to enter into a job of my choice.\nI would hope to take this opportunity to guide my mentee(s) to ensure that they know what they want in their future careers and hopefully, to be able to provide some tips and tricks along the way to help them get into their desired jobs.",

Mentorship is important not only for the mentees to understand the different career options, but also to learn and capitalise on the mentor's mistakes. \nThe reason why I want to be a mentor is to ensure that the youths understand what they want and be aware of their personalities while searching for a job. I would also hope to find a good fit for them as far as possible so that they will have lesser hiccups during the job searching journey and drop hints and tips along the way to benefit this group of youths.",

My first job was with McKinsey and I was involved in projects across Asia and Middle East. I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2007 and started my investing career with GIC at the peak of the last market cycle. While at GIC, I covered Private Equity, Energy and Venture and was so fortunate to learn how to invest there. I left GIC after 11+ years and am now on an entrepreneurial journey at a start-up fund where I have to learn fund raising and platform management. I also have two young children and balancing family and career is very important to me.",

Prior to Verisk Maplecroft, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center and a lecturer of global political economy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nI am keen to offer career and education advice to help the younger generation because I faced complicated job markets twice before. I finished my undergraduate studies when the global financial crisis hit the job market in 2008-09. A few years later, I continued with my PhD studies but when I finished it, the oil prices collapsed in 2015-16. I hope my experience in dealing with difficult times could help the younger generation in facing the disruption caused by the COVID-19.\n\nMy expertise focus on the political economy, energy trade, Chinese energy policy and ESG risks analysis (environmental, social and governance). I obtained my PhD in International Political Economy from King’s College London. He also holds an MSc in International Public Policy from UCL.",

      "Biography": "My background is international relations and War Studies and have lived and worked in Europe and Asia. I started my career in the public sector with the Singapore Ministry of Defence and the Economic Development Board (EDB), which gave me a precious perspective into public sector work and viewpoints. I then moved to Switzerland to join the non-profit world first with the World Economic Forum as a Global Leadership Fellow, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). My most memorable projects were launching a regional business alliance to promote sustainable palm oil in the region, and developing the sustainable seafood guide for Singapore. I am also active in the advocacy and activism space in Singapore mostly on environmental and wildlife issues, and have worked with MP Louis Ng's team the past 3 years notably leading the work to amend the Wildlife Animals and Birds Act recently. I was one of the key speakers at last year's inaugural Singapore Climate Rally at Hong Lim Park :) In my day job, I am very lucky to be on the frontlines tackling the climate and ecological emergency by working closely with businesses on plastics, climate change and sustainable fashion. We use a systems change and futures approach to help them create transformational change through scaling up innovative pilot projects across the industry. For self-care, I do sports and try to be in nature + read and listen to music. I am an avid climber and enjoy pushing myself out of my comfort zone!",

      "Why They Signed Up": "Schools generally teach you the academic stuff and if you're lucky, provide some moral guidance. From my personal experience, school did not teach me life skills or give me a set of tools to navigate the world that is messy, complex, uncertain and can be equally scary and exciting. I learnt many things and picked up life skills that foster the resilience that one needs to thrive in this world on my own. I wish had had a mentor. A mentor does not mean you won't have to learn those lessons yourself, but it can serve as a guide, a sounding board and support as one navigates the world oftentimes for the first time after leaving the comfort of home and school. I can probably relate to many youths in Singapore who are emerging from their slightly sheltered backgrounds and are having to make decisions and navigate the huge space in front of them. I have made lots of big and small decisions, good and wise ones, as well as wrong and not so good ones and through it, have picked up some good lessons. Perhaps I can pass some of that experience and knowledge on and perhaps I can be that guide for someone else in their journey of growth :)",

It was a humbling experience. After graduation, I started  my first job at the Singapore Economic Development Board from 2014 - 2016. At EDB, I worked with companies like Alibaba and SAP on their Southeast Asian strategies and investments into Singapore. Then, I took the plunge and joined a B2B startup in Shanghai for 4 years. China is amazing and the whole startup experience was real and cunning. We are truly very blessed back home in Singapore. As a result of Covid, the work arrangement did not work well anymore, so I had to say goodbye to China. Now, I’m with Singapore Business Federation.\n\nSo where am I in ending world poverty? Nowhere near. The world did not change much because of me. In fact, very very little. But at each stage, I’m equipping myself with more “ammunition”, so hopefully, when I am there one day, I will be ready.",

Further, when I was of this age, I was fortunate enough to receive help from my family and friends because I had access to great mentors. But not everyone has access to this. Therefore I think it is a great initiative.\nI also think that my journey towards joining the best business school in India and surviving two grilling years there, with a vast experience across domains like consulting, finance and research would be helpful to mentees in the future. I personally like helping out people and providing advice.",

She graduated from NUS with a B.Sc. in Life Sciences (2009) and Ph.D. in Marine Ecology (2013). While pursuing her degrees, Mei Lin became inspired by Singapore’s conservation workers, and took a strong interest in marine conservation issues. Mei Lin's passion to save the giant clams, her favourite marine animals, kickstarted two research programmes in Singapore to breed and raise clams to be placed onto our reefs. Mei Lin hopes to increase awareness on marine issues in Singapore and elsewhere through science communication. She believes that science can be used to change mindsets on environmental issues, and that this can only be done by making science relevant and relatable. Thus, Mei Lin strives to make science accessible through collaborations, engagements, and communication. For her efforts to generate social impact, Mei Lin received the Singapore Youth Award 2019. When not doing research, she actively volunteers with TeamSeagrass and Reef Friends to promote marine conservation and educate fellow volunteers. She is also an avid diver and photographer.",

      "Why They Signed Up": "I believe every conversation is an oppportunity for mentorship and that is a transformational two-way relationship. I have learnt so much from both my mentees and mentors while having the pleasure to give back to them as well. The best moments are when you schedule a coffee for 30 mins with someone you just connected with and before you know it you lost 3 hours of your work day talking about absolutely exciting stuff. To date, I have had 5 official mentees either through internship, school clubs or structured mentoring programs. I have also had 3 mentors who have guided me in similar structured situations. However, the most impactful forms of mentor-mentee relationships and the ones that I actively look for are those where two people connect and have an amazing rapport that grows into a long-term partnership or even friendship with each learning from the other.\n\nIts rather ironic but in today's information and advise addled world where everything can be Googled, learned on Coursera or read online, mentorship comes to the forefront in very unique ways. I personally got linked up with an alumni from SMU who was the president of the same club I took over, 4 years before me and happened to be working in LinkedIn then. Before I knew it, I was speaking to him about the world of commercial sales/business development in technology sector and it completely pivoted my life. This would never have happened through information I had available to consume or just studying my class content everyday. Rather, getting a real world perspective from anyone is always extremely beneficial. I have benefited from this in more ways than I can count. To this day, this mentor and I meet at least once a month to catch up and each conversation feels too short. This is why mentorship, collaboration and building true relationships with people who are keen to learn and explore this vast chaotic world together is more important than ever to me.",

This allows them to make informed decisions during their time in law school about subjects, internships, co-curricular activities such as mooting, etc. It's also helpful to have someone who can provide them with advice, or connect them with the right people.

He also volunteered for events with Singapore’s Space and Technology Association, which gave him opportunities to speak to people who were building satellites. This allowed him to realize a gap launch capability, which led to the formation of his company.",

Her projects include credit modelling, network theory analysis, infiltrating fraud chatrooms, and a police raid that shut down a USD 6M fraud farm operation in Jabodetabek.\n\nValerie was a former graduate of CJC (2011) where she spent quite a bit of time in detention.

This was driven by an interest in the shipping and energy industry from a young age, having taken up sailing as a hobby and subsequently as a co-curricular activity at 13 years old. This hobby later allowed me to go on to become Captain of both the CHIJ Toa Payoh Secondary School and St. Andrew's Junior College Sailing teams.\n\nI started my career as Trade Executive in Pacific International Lines, which has given me a strong foundation and understanding of operations in the liner trade. Then went on to join the Offshore Oil & Gas sector with Britoil Offshore Services Pte Ltd.\n\nAs Chartering Manager at MMA Offshore, I manage the Middle East, Brunei and Africa tenders, contract negotiations and project management.",

Then I enlisted in the Army as a clerk at 18.\n\nBut I refused to give in... I was commissioned as an Armour Officer, received my Sword of Merit SAF scholarship at 21. Got promoted to MAJOR at age 31.\n\nNot satisfied because I felt I could offer more to Life. I searched for a Mentor, to help unleash my hidden potential. I left the military in 2011 and venture into a totally unfamiliar, financial advisory industry (graduated from MPE in 2002).\n\nToday, I am an EntreProfessional, Investment Risk Manager, Investor, Business Leader and an NS Armoured Battalion Commander.\n\nI know its difficult to see the light beyond current troubling times, but I know its there for I had walked down the same path. Though the path is difficult, it is not pleasant, but it can be done because many, like me had done it before!\n\nI hope that my life experiences and sharing might serve as an inspiration for anyone who might be struggling to find their way amidst such turbulent and confusing times.",

The driving force behind my work is helping others realise their potential and exploring how to navigate the workforce as a journey, not a destination. I come from a linguistics background in university, and a deep rooted understanding in Korean language and culture brought me to working in the Korean government trade agency office in Singapore before joining NUS. Through my own journey, I've been fortunate to realise how I can combine existing interests and strengths to compliment acquired skills and experiences. This has allowed me to start authoring my own work journey and I would like to continue aiding youths to start taking agency of their own.",

Yeeli’s first job more than twenty years ago was that of a VLSI chip designer in Boston after getting a master’s degree in Electrical Engineering. No stranger to breaking glass ceilings, from classroom to boardroom, she shared “we are perceived to have limitations until we exceed expectations”. Her deep dive into the beauty industry started at Paris-based IN VIVO BVA where she advised FMCG brands such as P&G, and luxury brands such as The Estee Lauder Company, on how to win at retail with Asian consumers. Close to half a million consumer interviews later, she continued to see a gap – and a huge potential - for inclusive beauty products. Her current role as Founder of FA8 & CO. seeks to disrupt the beauty industry by introducing sustainable products designed specifically for Southeast Asia’s climate, religious and cultural diversity.
